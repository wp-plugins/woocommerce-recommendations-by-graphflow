== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

WooCommerce Recommendations by Graphflow turbo-charges your WooCommerce store with the power of industry-leading recommendations technology. Once installed and activated, you can show "similar product" recommendations on your product pages, cart recommendations on your cart pages before your customers check out, personalized user recommendations on your Shop and Product Category pages - or anywhere else in your store, using our flexible recommendation widget or shortcode.

All recommendations are based on the behaviour and activity on your site, allowing you to increase revenue by providing an enhanced and personalized experience to your customers.

= How does it work? =

Graphflow collects details on the customer events that occur in your store - including product page views, adding products to the cart, and purchases. Using your store's event data, Graphflow's state of the art recommendation engine generates personalized recommendations for your customers, as well as "similar products" for each of your products. 

You can choose any combination of the following:

1. Show similar product recommendations on your product pages
2. Show personalized user recommendations on your main Shop page and your Product Category pages
3. Show recommendations on your cart page before a customer checks out, based on the products in their cart and their individual activity history
4. Show recommendations anywhere on your site using our recommendations widget or shortcode. For example, you could show user recommendations on the Account page.

= What does it cost? =

It's free to get started. Our free plan gives you up to 300,000 events per month - so if your store volumes are below this, you won't pay anything.

Larger stores will need to sign up for one of our paid plans - we offer a 60-day fee trial for our Premium plans!

Go to www.graphflow.com/pricing for more details.

= What is an "Event"? =

An event is:

1. When a user interacts with a product - product view, add-to-cart, purchase, and so on; and
2. When we serve a recommendation - either a similar product, cart, or user recommendation

So, if your store has about 100,000 product page views per month, you can expect to utilise around 200,000 - 250,000 of your event quota per month. 

**Note** that this estimate is based on *product* page views - we only charge you based on data we collect, and recommendations we make to your customers.

For many stores, we expect our free plan of 300,000 events per month to be plenty. If you are a large store owner, you may need to sign up for one of our paid plans. We offer a 60-day trial period, and volume discounts for larger stores. Head over to www.graphflow.com/pricing for more details.

= Are there limits on how many products, users or events I can track? =

No, there are no limits imposed by our engine. In terms of cost, our free account gives you up to 300,000 events per month. If you have more volume than that, we require you to register for one of our paid plans.

= How are recommendations displayed? =

The plugin is designed to work "out of the box", with no additional configuration required once you've entered your access credentials. Recommendations are displayed as native WooCommerce product templates, integrating perfectly into your store's theme and styling.

However, it is fully customizable to suit your needs:

* Through the Settings page (found under `WooCommerce -> Settings -> Graphflow`), you can choose to turn on "similar product" recommendations, cart recommendations and user recommendations. You can also configure the number of recommendations, number of columns, and title that is displayed.
* You can drag and drop the Graphflow Recommendations Widget onto any widgetized area of your store to display smart recommendations. The widget allows configuration of the number of recommendations to display, as well as the title.
* Using the shortcode `[graphflow_recommendations]`, you can show recommendations anywhere in your store.
* Recommendation components have an HTML element id (`graphflow-recommendations`), allowing you to easily customise and style any recommendation output as required.

= How does this impact the load time of my store? =

We strive to make our service as fast and efficient as possible. We power recommendations on large volume sites and expect there to be no impact on your store's load time or performance.

= How long does it take to work? =

We do need to collect enough data for our engine to do its work, so it's usually best to give it a few days. To help our engine get off to a good start, we recommend that you export your product details and recent order history to Graphflow, using the `Export` buttons on the Graphflow settings page.

= I've tested the plugin on a development store, how do I migrate over to my live store? =

Currently, we require you to sign up for one account per store. If you have used your access keys for development or testing purposes, please [contact support](http://www.graphflow.com/contact-us/), and we will clear your test data so you can start fresh on your live store.

= My recommendations look strange =

We use state-of-the-art models to generate recommendations for your store. In fact, we give you access to the same powerful technology used by the largest websites and online stores in the world. The recommendations that are shown are created based on the user behaviour in your own store. Sometimes, this behaviour can result in recommendations that you may think look "weird", "odd" or even "wrong". Rest assured that in almost all cases, this is just our models uncovering patterns that are hidden or difficult to find for humans, but that are crystal clear to our powerful engine!

**Note** that sometimes, you may see the "baseline" recommendations that are part of our automatic, built-in split-testing functionality. We hope that the power of our recommendations will be apparent from this split-testing. You can see your recommendation performance by logging in to your Graphflow dashboard.

However, if you do see anything odd or have any questions around our recommendations, please get in touch with us. We're always on the lookout for ways to improve our product (or for bugs or other issues!).

= I've activated the plugin and entered my keys, but I'm not seeing any recommendations =

Our engine needs data to do its work. Customer event data is collected with each customer interaction on your store. You can kick start things by exporting some historical order information to Graphflow, by clicking on the `Export` orders button in the Graphflow settings page.

If you have exported your products and orders, and still don't see any recommendations, please check your error logs and let us know about it, so that we can look into any problems for you.

= The plugin doesn't work! =

If you're experiencing difficulties with installing, configuring or using the plugin, or are not happy with your results, please get in touch with us. We're always here to help and want to deliver the best possible experience for you and your customers. Your feedback, comments (and yes, criticism) are all useful to us!

= I'm getting errors when trying to export products or orders =

While we aim to make the export process as lightweight and efficient as possible, you may need to ensure you've allocated enough memory to Wordpress to make sure the export works as expected. If you run into problems, you can try to increase the memory allocated (check out this link for more details: http://codex.wordpress.org/Editing_wp-config.php#Increasing_memory_allocated_to_PHP). 

If you can't do this or it doesn't work for any reason, don't worry - we collect your data on the fly with each customer interaction, so we will quickly build up the information we need to power your recommendations.

= I'm seeing both Graphflow recommendations and WooCommerce related products on a page =

Our plugin hooks into standard WooCommerce extension points in order to replace the native related products display with Graphflow recommendations. While this works in general, some themes may have specific ways of displaying related products or up-sell products that work differently. In this case, you will need to disable the related product / up-sell display manually within the theme. If you come across this issue, please [contact support](http://www.graphflow.com/contact-us/) and let us know, and we will do our best to help you get this done.

= What analytics does Graphflow offer? =

Our dashboard gives you access to a wide range of analytics, including an event timeline, user and product activity summaries, and a detailed activity history view on a per-user and per-product basis.

We also provide a built-in split test, where we play our recommendation engine off against a baseline. The "AB Testing" overview dashboard shows how we're doing, and the value we are adding, at all times.

We're constantly working on improving our dashboard, reporting and analytics offerings, so please get in touch with your thoughts, comments and suggestions. We'd love to hear from you!

= Your plugin rocks! =

Thank you! Please tell your friends. We also welcome all your feedback, good or bad!
